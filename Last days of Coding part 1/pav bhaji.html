<h3><u>
    What is pav bahji
</u></h3>


<p style="background-color: orange;">
    <em style="font-size: 25px;"> Pav bhaji is an indian dish that is made of pf vegies and spices. Many times you will see it have a orange-ish color and that is made from beet. It is thwn topped off with butter for style and they give pav to eat it with and the pav has butter for taste. Sounds yummy!</em>

<h3>
    <u>Why Pav Bhaji is my favorite!</u>
</h3>


<p style="color: blue; background-color: pink; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 25px;">
    Pav bhaji is my favorite because it hase the best spice taste and best indian taste. The butter really enhances the taste! it has a good looking texture as any other nice mildly liquid bhaji. It is just the taste that makes the big difference!
